Atmospheric Cookbook
====================

Welcome to the Atmospheric Cookbook!  This is an Atmospheric Cookbook 📔 of Recipes for analysing regional or global atmospheric model output. 👩🏽‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳

We explain: a "recipe" here is an example an analysis of some atmospheric model output or some atmosphere-related observational datasets.
Each "recipe" comes in a self-contained and well-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

To access the data used in these recipes you need an account with the Australian-based `National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) <https://nci.org.au>`_

To get started have a look at the tutorials_ and then browse through the
available recipes_ to find something the better suits your 'taste' (i.e., your needs)!

Happy cooking! 😉 🥙 🍱 🍲
