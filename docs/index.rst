Atmosphere Cookbook
====================

Welcome to the Atmosphere Cookbook!  This is an Atmosphere Cookbook 📔 of Recipes for analysing
regional or global atmosphere model output. 👩🏽‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳

We explain: a "recipe" here is an example of an analysis of some atmosphere model output or some
atmosphere-related observational datasets.
Each "recipe" is a self-contained and well-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

To access the data used in these recipes you need an account with the
Australian-based `National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) <https://nci.org.au>`_.
In particular, you need access to projects *hh5* and *ua8*.

To get started, take a look at the tutorials_ and then browse through the
available recipes_ to find something relevant to your needs!

Happy cooking! 😉 🥙 🍱 🍲
